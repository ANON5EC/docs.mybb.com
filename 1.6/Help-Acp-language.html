<p>Some users have found their ACP to be blank or missing all text after installing MyBB. This is usually caused by missing ACP language files. To rectify this upload a fresh copy of your admin language files which are located in ./inc/languages/ *your language* /admin, also ensure that the file permissions are correctly set so MyBB can read the language files.
