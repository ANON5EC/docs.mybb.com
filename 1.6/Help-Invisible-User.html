<p>On the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1.6/Who-Is-Online/" title="Who Is Online">Who Is Online</a> list, administrators may see a * (asterisk/star) at the end of the username.  This indicates that the user has set himself to be "invisible."  To normal users the user will always be shown as "offline"
