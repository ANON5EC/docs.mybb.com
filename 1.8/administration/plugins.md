## About User Titles

User titles are text displayed under the username in posts, threads, profile and member list.
Each group has it's own default user title which is shown if a user doesn't use a custom one.

## How to set Default User Titles

You can set them to be default for one group or to be changed with number of posts a user has made.

#### Set User Titles According the Group

At `Admin Control Panel -> Users & Groups -> Groups -> <usergroup name>` You can give a default user title for that group.

Just fill out the **Default User Title** field.

#### Set User Titles According the Number of Users Posts

The "Registered" group by default has this option.

If you want to use that option, leave Default User Title field in group settings blank.

You can specify and edit number of posts, names or add new Custom User Titles at `Admin Control Panel -> Users & Groups -> User Titles`.

When adding or editing them, you have 4 options: Title to assign, Minimum posts, Number of stars, and Star image.

##### Title to Assign field

Here write text for Custom User Title

##### Minimum Posts

Here write minimum number of posts, requied before user got assigned this Custom User Title.

##### Number of Stars

Here you should put number of stars wich will be shown under user title. If you don't want stars, you will need to put 0 to that filed.

##### Star image

Here you should put star image url. That image will be shown like star in profiles.

## Edit Custom User Title for Specific User

You can easily edit your user title through your profile by going to `User CP -> Edit profile`. At right side of it you have Custom User Title filed. Just write your new user title and save.
