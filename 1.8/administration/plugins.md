## Plugin System
MyBB has one of the most advanced plugin systems found in bulletin boards today. It takes only minutes to install plugins that can make MyBB suit your needs even better. The active and friendly MyBB community has developed a large amount of plugins that are ready to use; amongst them are plugins to show all unanswered threads, extend the forum statistics, show the permissions one has in a forum and many more.

## How to install plugins
Most plugins will come with their own documentation on where the files included should go! If the mod does not come with documentation and contains a single php file then that file should be uploaded to `MyBB Root Folder/inc/plugins`.

If you then browse to `Admin Control Panel -> Configuration -> Plugins` you will see the plugin that you have recently uploaded listed, proceed by clicking the Activate or Activate and Install Button as shown below:

## How to uninstall plugins
Uninstalling plugins has never been so easy! Simply navigate to `Admin Control Panel -> Configuration -> Plugins` and you will see either a Deactivate or an Uninstall button click whichever one appears and your plugin will be uninstalled.

You should then delete all the files that you uploaded for this plugin to ensure that it is no longer part of your MyBB Installation.

## Reporting a Plugin
If you find that the plugin you are using contains a security exploit or any other severe issues which will affect other users. Please note that this does not include bugs or glithces which only affect the way that the plugin in question operates.

Then please browse to the MyBB Mod site, and browse to the plugin which you wish to report and click the report link on the right and side and include as much detail as you can. 

It is vital that you report the plugin, as it will ensure that any other MyBB sites do not encounter the same thing that you have.
