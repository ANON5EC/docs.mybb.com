## Plugin System
MyBB has one of the most advanced plugin systems found in bulletin boards today. It takes only minutes to install plugins that can make MyBB suit your needs even better. The active and friendly MyBB community has developed a large amount of plugins that are ready to use; amongst them are plugins to show all unanswered threads, extend the forum statistics, show the permissions one has in a forum and many more.

## How to upload plugins
Most plugins will come with their own documentation on where the files included should go! If the mod does not come with documentation and contains a single php file then that file should be uploaded to `MyBB Root Folder/inc/plugins`.

If you then browse to `Admin Control Panel -> Configuration -> Plugins` you will see the plugin that you have recently uploaded listed, proceed by clicking the Activate or Activate and Install Button.
