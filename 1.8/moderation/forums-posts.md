## Announcements

![Announcements List screen](/assets/images/mod-cp/mod-cp-announcements.jpg)

This section allows you to add forum announcements to a specific forum (and any children) or to all forums.

The top table is for Global Announcements. You can add a global announcement from the link at the top right of the table.

From the announcement listing page, you see a listing of all forums on the board. For each forum, you can choose to add a new announcement (**Add Announcement**). Beneath each forum is a listing of its forum announcements, with an indicator showing if it is within its date limits. If it is not within its date limits, it will not be shown. You can edit or delete each announcement.

### Adding/Editing an Announcement

## Report Center

![Reported post screen](/assets/images/mod-cp/mod-cp-reported-post.jpg)

The Report Center will contain all reported content by your users: Reputation, User Profiles and/or User Posts.

Reported posts are posts that have been marked by users as rule breaking, and have been sent to moderators for review. For each reported post, you can see the post ID, the poster, the thread, the reporter, the reason for reporting, and the date and time the post was reported. Reports that are in forums you moderate are highlighted in pink (by default).

To mark reported posts as read, select the report and click **Mark Selected as Read** at the bottom of the page. If you marked all as read, doing so will remove the notice regarding reported posts at the top of every page.

You can also choose to view all reported posts, even those that have already been marked as read. The same information is provided. On this page, unread reports (and not those in forums you moderate) are highlighted in pink (by default).

## Moderator Logs

![Moderator logs screen](/assets/images/mod-cp/mod-cp-moderator-logs.jpg)

The Moderator Log section in the Mod CP lists all moderator actions that have been performed on your board, including those made by normal users, such as deleting their own post or thread.

For each action, you will see the username, date and time the action was performed, the action, relevant information (including the thread and forum), and the IP address. If the action performed was using a custom moderator tool, the action will include the name of the custom moderator tool.

### Filter Moderator Logs

You can filter moderator logs by:

 1. Forum (you are given a listing of all forums on your forum)
 2. Forum Moderator (you are given a listing of all users who have performed moderator actions)

You can also sort the logs by:
 1. Date
 2. Username
 3. Forum Name
 4. Thread Subject
 
You can sort in ascending or descending order. You can also choose to specify the number of results per page.
