# User Control Panel

The User Control Panel is available to registered members (with appropriate permissions) to manage their user profile. At the top of the menu, you are provided with a link back to the User CP home page.

## Messenger

The private messaging (also known as PM) system allows forum members to communicate one-on-one in private, like email, but hosted on the forum. The private messages section is described in more detail in the Private Messages article.

The menu includes the following links:

**Compose**

This allows you to send a private message to another user. 
    
**Inbox**

This is your folder of received and unfiled messages. 
    
**Sent Items** 

This folder contains private messages you have sent.
    
**Drafts** 

This folder contains private messages you have written but have not sent. 
    
**Trash Can**

This folder contains messages you have deleted.
    
**Tracking** 

This page allows you to track messages you have sent - allowing you to see if and when a user has read your message. If they have not read the message, you can delete the message from their inbox. 
    
**Edit Folders** 

This page allows you to add additional folders, allowing you to file your private messages, similar to email. 

From any of the folders, you can also access the **Empty Folders** and **Download Messages** pages.

## Your Profile

The **Your Profile** section deals with everything relating to your account and your profile.

### Edit Profile

Various profile fields are available for you to describe yourself and publicize your contact information. These include:

![Edit profile screen](/assets/images/user-cp/edit-profile.jpg)

### Required Fields

The only required field, by default, is your email address, which you can change from the change email page. However, custom profile fields may be set as required. If any custom profile fields have been set as required, these will be displayed here as well.

### Optional Fields

**Date of Birth** 

Your date of birth. 
    
**Date of Birth Privacy** 

You can choose to either display age and date of birth publicly, only display your age, or hide age and date of birth. Hiding your age and date of birth will only allow the administrative staff to see it. 
    
**Your Website URL** 

If you have a website, you can enter it here. 


### Additional Information

Custom profile fields that are not required are displayed here.

**Custom User Title**

Your custom user title is displayed beneath your username in your posts, as well as in the member list, in events posted by you, and in your profile. User titles are often assigned based on user group or post count. However, if the administrator has allowed it for your user group, you may also set yourself a custom user title.

Your default user title is displayed first, and then your current user title. To keep your current user title, leave the field blank and do not check the checkbox. To set a custom user title, enter one into the field. If you wish to revert your user title to your group default (your **default user title**), check the checkbox labeled **Revert to group default**.

### Additional Contact Information

In addition to your email address, private messaging, and your website, you can choose to set a ICQ number, AIM screen name, MSN ID, and Yahoo! ID. These will be displayed publicly. (Note: Your email address is NEVER displayed publicly.)

### Away Information

You can also set your status as away, to tell other users you are not currently available.

To set your status to away, first select **I'm Away**. Then, enter in a reason for being away, to be displayed to other users. If you have a return date, you may also set this (in the format Day-Month-Year).

### Change Username

If the administrator has given your user group permission to change their username, you can change it via this page (the link is only displayed if you have the permissions to change your username). To change your username, you must also supply your current password.

### Change Password

This page allows you to change the password used to access your account. You must also supply your current password in order to change your password.

### Change Email

This page allows you to change the email address associated with your account. To change your email address, you must also supply your current password.

### Change Avatar

This page allows you to change the avatar that is displayed in your posts, in the member list, and in your profile. The administrator may specify a size limit for avatars, including both the dimensions and file size.

You can choose avatars using two methods:

 1. **Upload** - You can upload an avatar from your computer.
 2. **Remote URL** - You can type in a URL to an image file somewhere on the internet that you want to use as your avatar. 

The board administrator may also enable a feature that will automatically resize avatars. If set to automatically resize large avatars, any avatar over the specified limit will be automatically resized. If set to give users the choice of resizing large avatars, you will need to check **Try to resize my avatar if it is too large** to have your avatar automatically resized if too large. If the administrator has disabled automatic resizing of avatars, you will be asked to upload another image if your avatar is too large.

Uploading a new avatar will replace your current avatar. Also, if you wish to have no avatar, you may select **Remove Avatar** at the bottom of the page, which will leave you with no avatar.

### Change Signature

This page allows you to change the signature that can be displayed below your posts and provides the option of changing whether or not your signature is displayed. You can choose **Enable my signature in all of my posts**, **Disable my signature in all of my posts**, or **Leave my signature settings alone**.

A MyCode editor is displayed, in addition to the smilie listing. The administrative-set permissions for signatures are also displayed, including whether smilies, MyCode, [img] tags, and HTML are enabled, as well as the maximum number of characters allowed.
