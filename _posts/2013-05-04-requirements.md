## Minimum Requirements

MyBB 1.8 and the Merge System have a few minimum system requirements:

- PHP >= 5.2
- foo, bar, foobar PHP extensions
- MySQL >= 5.0, PostgreSQL >= 8 or SQLite >= 3
- Apache, nginx or IIS webserver

## Recommendations

Although not required, to take full advantage of MyBB's capabilities we highly recommend:

- PHP 5.4
- MySQL 5.5
