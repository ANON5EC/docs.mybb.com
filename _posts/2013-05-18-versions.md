As with any software, there are various different types of upgrades. They vary in size, difficulty and the type of changes being made. With MyBB, we follow a sequenced-based version scheme to describe the changes we've made.

## Major Point Upgrades

A major upgrade is where the version number changes. For example, going from version 1.x to 2.x. This type of change means that plugins, themes and language packs will need major changes to work on the new version.

## Minor Point Upgrades

This type of update means the minor number of the version changes. For example, going from version 1.6.x to 1.8.x. This type of change might require some changes to plugins, themes and language packs.

## Maintenance Point Upgrades

The maintenance upgrade makes small changes, mostly bug fixes, to the minor point versions. These can also be security upgrades. As an example, going from version 1.6.2 to 1.6.3 or 1.6.1 to 1.6.4 is a maintenance point upgrade. These changes are meant to make the new version more stable than the last. It is very unlikely that any changes to plugins are needed, but language packs or themes may need to be updated.
