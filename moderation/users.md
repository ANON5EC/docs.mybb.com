The Profile Editor allows moderators to manage some of the common aspects of a user's profile.

The Users listing page displays a listing of all users on the forum (in pages). For each user, you are shown the username, primary group, registration date, last visit, and post count.

At the bottom of the page, you can search for users by username, and can specify how the users should be sorted.
