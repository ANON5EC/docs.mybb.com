## Mods Site Documentation

### For Downloaders

As a user you're simply looking to download something: a plugin, a theme, an icon set, perhaps a language pack or just some other resource that you may find interesting.

For that reason, you can quickly navigate from the menu to one of the 5 main categories:
- Plugins & Modifications
- Themes
- Graphics
- Resources
- Language Packs

Each main category has sub-categories, each with filtering options.

Placing the mouse over one of the project boxes quickly allows you to download the latest **stable** build and view how many times the project has been recommended.
Clicking the project names directs you towards the project page, on which you can see detailed information: full description, previews, license, suggestions, bugs, etc.
