You can see your projects and the projects you are involved in (as a contributor) as well as any pending project invitations sent to you.


#### Start a Project

If you wish to start a project, you must click New Project to expand the project options.

All fields are required, so you will need to fill them all. You are also asked to upload a ZIP of your project's files.

The build is considered a 'development' build so you will need to request for it to be changed to 'stable' at a later point.

#### Manage Projects

On this page you can see a list of all projects you are in involed in and the projects you own.

You can also send invitations from this page.
