  + Adding support for 4-Byte UTF-8 Unicode Encoding in MySQL
  + When MySQL 5.5.3 or above is used a new option to convert the tables to 4-Byte UTF-8 Unicode Encoding is available in the **UTF-8 Conversion** page in the Admin Control Panel. This allows to store unicode characters with 4 bytes. If you don't know what we are talking about you probably don't need it. PgSQL and SQLite can store such characters by default.
