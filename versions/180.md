# MyBB 1.8.0

MyBB 1.8 will be the next minor version of MyBB following the 1.6.x release cycle. It is currently in development. There is no estimated release date for MyBB 1.8 at this time.

While a new default theme, trash can and a move to jQuery have all been confirmed, there are lots of other new features that will be in 1.8 that are yet to be anounced. Stay tuned to the MyBB Blog for the tour.
